3. **Get Test Tokens**: Acquire BDAG tokens from the testnet faucet

### **Creating Predictions**
1. Navigate to "Create Prediction" page
2. Enter your prediction question (e.g., "Will BTC reach $100k by December 2024?")
3. Add detailed description for clarity
4. Set voting deadline (when predictions close)
5. Set resolution time (when you can resolve the outcome)
6. Submit transaction and wait for confirmation

### **Making Predictions**
1. Browse "All Predictions" or view featured predictions on homepage
2. Select a prediction you want to participate in
3. Choose "Predict Yes" or "Predict No"
